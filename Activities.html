	<h1>Water Activities</h1>
		<p class="para1">We offer a wide range of fun water activities that allow our camp members to cool off in the hot summer sun. <br />
				 We structured our programs to help build the next generation that will lead us into the future. 
				 We formed team building activities around the many programs we offer at the camp. Our hope is that our attendies will leave with 
				important skills that they will use throughout their life. The fun activities that we offer are swimming, tubbing, kyacking, canoe's, and paddle boards.
